Enables "Single Sign-Ons" between related Drupal sites on one server
with a shared database.

Installation and activation are simple:
  + Put this file in your modules directory.
  + If you're not also using the "domain" module
    + If you haven't done so already, create site sub-directories in the
      "sites" directory for each of your domains.  Put "settings.php"
      files in each of those directories.  Edit each of the settings.php
      files to values appropriate for the given domain.
    + Make sure the "$db_prefix" variable is set correctly in each
      settings.php file (see details below).
    + Create the site specific and shared database tables defined in the
      "$db_prefix" variable (see details below).
    + On each site, starting with the master site:
       + Log in as administrator.
       + Enable the "singlesignon" module
          (via the checkbox in the administer | modules interface).
       + Enter the URL of the master site
          (via administer | settings | singlesignon).
    + Delete cookies from all of your Drupal sites.

This module relies on several tables being shared between the master and
slave sites.  Here is an example of the "$db_prefix" variable you need to
establish in all of your "settings.php" files in the "sites" directory.
Each site should have a unique name in place of "somesitename_".  While
you can rename "shared_" to something else, the prefixes must be the
same for all sites.

$db_prefix = array(
  'default'        => 'somesitename_',
  'authmap'        => 'shared_',
  'profile_fields' => 'shared_',
  'profile_values' => 'shared_',
  'role'           => 'shared_',
  'sequences'      => 'shared_',
  'sessions'       => 'shared_',
  'users'          => 'shared_',
  'users_roles'    => 'shared_',
  'users_uid_seq'  => 'shared_',  // for pgsql
);
