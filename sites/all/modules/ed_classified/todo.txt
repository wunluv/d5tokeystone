- (done) Add contact links in link hook (just use user contact page)
- limit length of body form field to current limit lenght so people know length limit while editing
- optionally, don't allow posting to non-leaf taxonomy term (in form validate)
- Use radio buttons or checkboxes for taxonomy selection (show grid?)
- Add "more..." link in recent/popular block; simple page/pager combo to display 'em

- Views integration - expose our custom data (expiration time) to views
   http://drupal.org/node/42609

- Add checkbox on ad creation, to allow people to contact you via your contact info
- add link if contact via website is permitted - take them user contact form
- add a block at bottom of any ad or category: "create an ad for this category" or somesuch
- Add a block at bottom of any ad or category: "suggest a new category"
- Auto-add submission guidelines on install, or somehow add length and expiration info to edit form
- if location api/module available and the user has a location defined, 
  populate the location field from the user record!!!

- change column names to classified_xxx (prefix with classified_ to prevent collisions with other node data)

- default expiration time by category (if set)

- Notification emails: periodically send email to ad 'owner' (creator) with list of all current ads, by expiration date, 
  with links to each ad (and link to delete, or renew.)

- Need way to automatically extend or renew batches of ads (all, some, expired, etc.)
