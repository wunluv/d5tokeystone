DESCRIPTION
----

This module automatically updates the time zone setting on users accounts. This is accomplished by using JavaScript on the client machine to send the data back to the server. The benefit is that users don't have to manually update their time zone in their profile.

MODULE OPTIONS
----

The setting "Site configuration->Date and time->Configurable time zones" must be Enabled for this module to work.

This module has the optional feature of setting a $_SESSION['timezone'] variable for guest users. This feature can be taken advantage of in custom code or other modules when a guest user’s time zone is needed. The Value of $_SESSION['timezone'] is in minutes from GMT.
