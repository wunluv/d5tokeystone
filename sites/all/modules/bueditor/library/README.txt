All javascript files in this directory(not including subdirectories) will be loaded on
pages displaying an editor. These files are common and are loaded for all editors.
To load specific files for a specific editor you must create a subdirectory with the
same name as the editor and put your files in it. For examle, a subdirectory named
as editor1 will be scanned for only the editor whose name=editor1.
