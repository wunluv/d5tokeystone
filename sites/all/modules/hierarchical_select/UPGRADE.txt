Upgrading (from Hierarchical Select 2 to 3)
-------------------------------------------
1) Upgrade this module just like any other: overwrite existing files and run
   update.php.

2) Upgrade to jQuery Update 2.

3) Disable and uninstall the jQuery Interface module. It's no longer necessary
   and in fact it's even *incompatible*.

4) If you're using Views, update to the Views 5.x-1.x-dev tarball of May 11 or
   later, or apply this patch:
   http://drupal.org/files/issues/hs_compatibility.patch

5) All modules that Hierarchical Select integrates with are split out into
   their own module now! Go to admin/build/modules (Site building -> Modules)
   and enable all the modules you'd like to use. E.g.:
   - Taxonomy: enable the Hierarchical Select Taxonomy module
   - Taxonomy exposed filters in Views: enable the Hierchical Select Taxonomy 
     Views module

6) One very special case: if you had been using Hierarchical Select for your
   content_taxonomy CCK fields, you had been told to use the "select" widget,
   Hierarchical Select would automatically override it. Well, that's no longer
   the case. Now there's a CCK widget especially for content_taxonomy CCK
   fields! Go through these steps:
   - enable the Hierarchical Select Content Taxonomy module
   - change the widget to "Hierarchical Select" for the fields on which you'd
     like to use Hierarchical Select
