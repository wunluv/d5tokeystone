Step By Step Installation for sites needing 'automatic promotion to front page':
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

01) Download and decompress the vote_up_down, links, votingapi, actions,
    voting_actions, views, and userpoints modules (listed above).

02) Upload the resulting directories to your /sites/all/modules/ directory.
    If this directory does not exist, please create it.

03) Log into your site as an admin user, and navigate to the
    www.example.com/admin/build/modules page.

04) Enable these modules:
    * Actions
    * Links
    * Userpoints
    * Views
    * Storylink
    * Vote up/down
    * Voting API Actions
    * Voting API

05) Next, go to www.example.com/admin/user/access and enable the following items
    * userpoints module
      ** view userpoints (for anonymous and authenticated)
    * vote_storylink module
      ** create storylinks (for authenticated; only if you wish to allow users
                            to create storylink posts for others to vote on)
      ** edit own storylinks (for authenticated; only if you wish to allow
                              users to edit their own storylinks)
    * vote_up_down module
      ** use up-down vote (for authenticated)
      ** view up-down vote (for anonymous and authenticated)

06) Go to www.example.com/admin/build/actions and click 'list'
    (this allows the Actions module to detect available actions).

07) Go to www.example.com/admin/content/types/storylink, and
    uncheck 'promoted to front page' (under workflow).

08) Go to www.example.com/admin/settings/vote_up_down
    * Under types, check 'storylink'.
    * Under Vote widget settings for nodes, in the field below
      "Vote widget display"", select 'disabled'.
    * Under "Vote widget settings for comments", in the "Vote widget display"
      and "Link display of vote points", select 'do not display for both'.

09) Go to www.example.com/admin/settings/userpoints
    * To enable credit for just voting and creating storylinks, enter the
      amounts you wish to give for them in the below fields.
    * "Points for posting a story link" and the
      "Points for voting on a node(requires the Vote up/down module)".

10) Go to www.example.com/admin/settings/voting_actions
    * Under "action set name", enter in a field "Promote node to front page"
      then click Save.
    * Select edit and enter the following:
      - select points under value type.
      - enter vote under tag.
      - enter sum under function.
      - select is greater than under comparison.
      - enter the required number for front page promotion.
      - under action select "Promote node to front page" and click Save.
      - under action select "Award userpoints from..." and click Save.

Also see the screenshot at 
/sites/all/modules/vote_up_down/documentation/voting_actions_examples/Promote_to_front_page.png

11) Go to www.example.com/admin/settings/voting_actions
    * Under action set name, enter in a field other than promote node to
      front page, "demote node from front page" then click Save.
    * Select edit and enter the following:
    - select points under value type.
    - enter vote under tag.
    - enter sum under function.
    - select is less than under comparison.
    - enter the required number for front page demotion.
    - under action select "Remove node from front page" and click Save.
    - under action select "Deduct userpoints from..." and click Save.

/sites/all/modules/vote_up_down/documentation/voting_actions_examples/Demote_from_front_page.png

12) Upload the node-storylink.tpl.php and template.php to the directory
    of your theme. If you already have a template.php, you will have to
    merge them. Merging instructions for the faint-of-heart are at
    http://drupal.org/phptemplate and http://drupal.org/node/152426.

OBS! When using "node-storylink.tpl.php" you must turn off
"Vote widget display..." in "admin/settings/vote_up_down" to avoid
getting double voting widgets.

And you're done!
