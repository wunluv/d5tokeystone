Readme
------

This is a simple smiley-filter that allows the easy use of graphical smileys (or 'emoticons') on a Drupal site. It comes with a set of example smileys, but you can define an unlimited amount of custom smileys as well.

NOTE: Please don't rip the example smileys and use them without this module. I spent quite some time creating those little buggers.

Installation
------

1. Extract and copy the contents of smileys package to the Drupal "modules/" directory.

3. Go to the administration section, into "Adminster > Site building > Modules" and enable the smileys module.

4. Go to the "smileys" page in "Administer > Site configuration > Smileys" and add your own smileys. There are two blank smiley pictures included in the example package to get you started.

6. Go to "Administer > Site configuration > Input formats" and enable smileys filtering for certain Input formats.
