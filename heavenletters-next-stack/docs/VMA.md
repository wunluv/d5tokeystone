# Heavenletters Next Stack - Vision, Mission, Aims (VMA)

**Version 1.4** (Updated 2025-09-29: Integrated future vision, promise to Gloria, sustainability models, and online Godwriting workshop/community. Draws from historical context in HISTORY.md to emphasize legacy continuation, volunteer ethos, and global reach.)

## Vision
Heavenletters.org as a timeless digital sanctuary, honoring Gloria Wendroff's grassroots Godwriting legacy from 1988. A beacon of spiritual inspiration where anyone - seeker or everyday person - accesses profound, free wisdom to transform lives. The new stack (KeystoneJS backend, AstroJS frontend) ensures ad-free simplicity, multilingual accessibility, and sustainable growth, fulfilling the promise to make Heavenletters' therapeutic effects known worldwide. Echoing Gloria's journey: from private notes to global sharing, the site evolves as a living testament to oneness, letting God's light shine through technology without commercial barriers.

## Mission
Migrate the legacy Drupal 5 site (6,620 Heavenletters across 10+ languages) to a modern, performant stack while preserving content integrity, SEO, RSS syndication, and volunteer-driven spirit. Build financial sustainability through innovative, non-intrusive models (ebooks, subscriptions, premium access) to fund operations since 2006. Launch an online Godwriting workshop and community to empower users in developing personal relationships with God through writing, extending Gloria's co-facilitated global workshops. Prioritize zero-downtime, WCAG accessibility, and organic growth to reach a worldwide audience, honoring the site's origins in free, heart-led sharing.

## Aims
### Core Migration Aims (Phases 1-5)
1. **Content Preservation**: Sync all Heavenletters (nid, title, publish_number, publish_date, body, locale, translations via tnid) from Drupal DB to Keystone schema; maintain UTF-8 integrity and historical numbering for seamless multilingual access.
2. **Performance & Simplicity**: Leverage AstroJS for static SSG pages (e.g., /en/heavenletter/[number]) with islands for dynamics (search, language switching); ensure <2s load times, mobile-first with Tailwind CSS.
3. **SEO & Discoverability**: Implement 301 redirects from legacy URLs; generate sitemaps/RSS; optimize meta tags for spiritual queries (e.g., "God's wisdom on love").
4. **Admin Ease for Volunteers**: Keystone UI with role-based access (simple CRUD for Heavenletters, no coding needed); integrate historical volunteer ethos for community moderation.
5. **Testing & Launch**: Parity checks (content/search match Drupal); E2E tests with Playwright; deploy on Netlify (Astro)/Railway (Keystone) with monitoring (Sentry); quarterly reviews post-launch.

### Sustainability Aims (Phase 3.5)
1. **Revenue Models**: Generate multilingual ebooks (PDF/EPUB exports from Keystone) for purchase; implement subscriptions/premium content (e.g., ad-free archives, exclusive Q&A) via Stripe in Astro islands; aim for self-funding to end out-of-pocket since 2006.
2. **Global Reach**: Track metrics (traffic +20% YoY, subscription growth); use i18n for 10+ languages; promote via RSS/social meta to amplify therapeutic impact.

### Community & Workshop Aims (Post-MVP)
1. **Online Godwriting Workshop**: Develop 2-3 week program as interactive Keystone/Astro modules (daily writing prompts, video lessons from Gloria's co-facilitation); include progress tracking and user auth.
2. **Community of Practice**: Build forum for sharing Godwriting experiences (Astro islands or Discourse integration); foster volunteer-led discussions, echoing site's oneness theme; user-generated content with moderation to nurture personal God relationships.
3. **Legacy Fulfillment**: Honor promise to Gloria (pre-2024 passing) by sustaining free core access while innovating for growth; measure success by user transformations (e.g., feedback on spiritual connections).

## Guiding Principles (From History)
- **Free Sharing First**: Core content remains open (like 2003 emails); revenue enhances, doesn't gatekeep.
- **Volunteer Ethos**: Easy tools for community (e.g., Keystone for admins, workshop for facilitators).
- **Simplicity & Oneness**: Minimalist design (Astro's low JS); themes of letting go, pure honesty in all features.
- **Therapeutic Focus**: Prioritize emotional/spiritual impact (e.g., search by themes like grief/love).

## Success Metrics
- **Short-Term**: 100% content migration, <1% error rate in sync; site live with zero downtime.
- **Medium-Term**: 50+ subscribers in Year 1; workshop enrollment (100 users); global traffic from 10+ countries.
- **Long-Term**: Self-sustaining revenue ($10k+/year); active community (1k members); quarterly VMA reviews to adapt.

This VMA aligns with PROJECT_ROADMAP.md; updates reflect user-provided future vision for sustainability and Godwriting expansion.
